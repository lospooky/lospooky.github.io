Ever since being first exposed to it, I've always tried to pursue AI as my career path...
</p>
<p>
After obtaining a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering in 2008 and a Master's in
Intelligent Systems Design in 2010, for four years I've been the R&D and technical
half of a two-men firm.<br>
From scratch, we successfully developed a Genetic Programming based system for the evolution of financial trading strategies
and set up our live production workflow.<br>
Unfortunately, that experience abruptly ended in June 2014.
</p>
<p>
Since then I've been putting most of my energies respecializing towards Machine Learning with a particular interest in Deep Learning,
catching up with the great leaps forward the field has done since my student days...

Born, raised, and now back in Milano, Italy. I lived in Gothenburg, Sweden from mid 2008 to early 2013.

Also, while never being my primary focus, I've always had an inclination towards research and over the years I managed to publish some
of it. <a href="./publications.html"><b>Check it out</b></a>.
