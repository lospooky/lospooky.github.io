Ever since being first exposed to it, I've always tried to pursue AI as my career path...
</p>
<p>
After obtaining a Bachelor's in Computer Engineering in 2008 and a Master's in
Intelligent Systems Design in 2010, for four years I've been the R&D and technical
half of a two-men firm.<br>
From scratch, we successfully developed a Genetic Programming based system for the evolution of financial trading strategies
and set up our live production workflow.<br>
Unfortunately, that experience abruptly ended in June 2014.
</p>
<p>
Since then I've been putting most of my energies respecializing towards Machine Learning with a particular interest in Deep Learning,
catching up with the great leaps forward the field has done since my student days...

Born, raised, and now back in Milano, Italy. I lived in Gothenburg, Sweden from mid 2008 to early 2013.

If you're interested, here's my CV.

Also, while never being my primary focus, I've always had an inclination towards research and over the years I managed to publish some
of it. Check it out.
