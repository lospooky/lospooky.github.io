<b>Why Spooky Stuff?</b><br>
Spooky is a nickname I've had since my very first days on the Internet and over time that sorta bled over to the real world as well... So I embraced it.<br>
&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
Anyways, I am Simone Cirillo<br>
and ever since being first exposed to it, I've always been very interested and passionate about Artificial Intelligence and all that surrounds it...<br>
In 2008 I obtained a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering and in 2010 a Master's Degree in Intelligent Systems Design.<br>
</p>
<p>
Then, in my first professional life, I was the R&D and technical half of a two-men firm.<br>
Starting from scratch, we successfully developed a Genetic Programming based system for the evolution of financial trading strategies
and set up our live production workflow.<br>
Unfortunately, that experience abruptly ended in June 2014.
</p>
<p>
After that I decided to take a sabbatical where I spent most of my energies respecializing towards Machine Learning with a particular interest in Deep Learning,
catching up with the great leaps forward the field had done since my student days...
</p>
<p>
In January 2016 I joined Horus Technology, now <a href="http://eyra.io"><b>Eyra</b></a>, as Machine Learning Engineer.<br>
We're developing <a href="http://horus.tech"><b>Horus</b></a>, an innovative assistive device for the blind and the visually impaired!<br>
My day-to-day activities there involve an exciting mix of design and training of various deep neural networks, more classical machine learning models,
as well as regular software development.

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
Born, raised, and now back in Milano, Italy. I lived in Gothenburg, Sweden from mid 2008 to early 2013.

If you're interested, here's my <a href="https://github.com/lospooky/lospooky.github.io/raw/master/_filesfordl/simonecirillo-cv.pdf"><b>CV</b></a>.
</p>
<p>
Also, while never being my primary focus, I've always had an inclination towards research and over the years I managed to publish some
of it. <a href="./publications.html"><b>Check it out</b></a>.
