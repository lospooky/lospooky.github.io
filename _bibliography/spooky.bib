  Abstract                 = {In this paper we describe a novel implementation of the Interpreter class for the metaheuristic optimization framework HeuristicLab, comparing it with the three existing interpreters provided with the framework. The Interpreter class is an internal software component utilized by HeuristicLab for the evaluation of the symbolic expression trees on which its Genetic Programming (GP) implementation relies. The proposed implementation is based on the creation and compilation of a .NET Expression Tree. We also analyze the Interpreters' performance, evaluating the algorithm execution times on GP Symbolic Regression problems for different run settings. Our implementation results to be the fastest on all evaluations, with comparatively better performance the larger the run population size, dataset length and tree size are, increasing HeuristicLab's computational efficiency for large problem setups.},

  Abstract                 = {Progressive matrix problems are frequently used in modern IQ tests. In a progressive matrix problem, the task is to identify the missing element that completes the pattern of a pictorial matrix. We present a method for solving progressive matrix problems. The method is not limited to problems that are on the multiple choice format, which makes it potentially useful for solving real-world pattern discovery problems that do not come with predefined answer alternatives. The method is anthropomorphic in the sense that it uses certain problem solving strategies that were reported by high-achieving human solvers. We also describe a computer program implementing this method. The computer program was tested on the sets C, D, and E of Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices test and it produced correct solutions for 28 of the 36 problems considered. This score corresponds roughly to an IQ of 100. Finally, we conclude that it is possible to solve progressive matrix problems without analyzing potential answer alternatives and discuss some implications of this finding.},

  Abstract                 = {The report describes a computer program for solving Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM), a multiple choice test of abstract reasoning introduced by Dr. John C. Raven in 1936. Each RPM problem consists of a grid (or matrix) of 2x2 or 3x3 cells with graphical content, where the cell content in the bottom right corner is omitted; the solver's task is to pick the missing content from a set of eight solution candidates.
We argue these problems are not only mathematical, but also psychological in nature. Due to this and other considerations such as algorithmic transparency, the program makes use of a simple cognitive model.
The program solves RPM problems in a fully automatic fashion, without taking the solution candidates into account. The input is an RPM problem represented as a vector graphics file; the output is a complete or partial solution for the missing entry, represented in the same format. Internally we use multi-layered structures which enable the perception of the problems' different organizational levels.
The program was tested on sections C, D and E of the Standard Progressive Matrices(SPM) and produced correct solutions for 28 of the 36 considered problems.},
