  <li> <b>Ravensolver</b><br>
  <div style="padding-bottom:4px;"> Ravensolver is an automated solver for progressive matrix problems, a widely used type of abstract reasoning test.
  It was me and my working partner Master's Thesis project. Ravensolver was the first program explicitly designed to solve progressive matrix problems without
  taking the answer alternatives into account. For more information, please read our
  <a href="http://studentarbeten.chalmers.se/publication/123536-an-anthropomorphic-solver-for-ravens-progressive-matrices">thesis manuscript</a>
  or the <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cogsys.2012.08.002">journal article</a> we produced from it.</div>

  <li> <b>SynoShows scripts</b><br>
  <div style="padding-bottom:4px;">
  Having owned a Synology NAS for years and following a lot of TV Shows, at some point I decided to fully automate the workflow around them.<br>
  The <i>upstream</i> section was easily taken care of: a RSS subscription monitored by the Synology's own Downloadstation.<br>
  For the post-download processing, instead I had to write my own scripts. They rename episode files, move them to the archiving directory,
  and finally send a convenient Pushbullet notification about the completed download.<br>
  After a little restructuring and cleanup, here they are as SynoShows.</div>
